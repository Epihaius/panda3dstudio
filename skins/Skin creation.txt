A custom skin can be created for Panda3D Studio; three files are required, located in their own, user-created subdirectory of the "skins" directory:

*) "atlas.png": a texture atlas containing the graphics used for the various parts and states of each GUI widget;
*) "atlas.txt": a plain text file listing the regions of those graphics in the texture atlas, as well as the inner and outer borders of the different widget types;
*) "skin.txt": a plain text file defining what fonts, cursors and colors are to be used for which purposes; some general skin options are set here too. This file is not strictly necessary; if it is missing, the one from the default skin will be used.

The "atlas.png" and "atlas.txt" files can be generated by extracting the Python file "atlas.py" from the "default/atlas.zip" archive and running it in the directory that contains the separate widget graphics files. This Python file will not only look for all of these widget part image files, but also for "borders.txt" and "gfx_ids.txt" (in the same directory), which are plain text files. The former, "borders.txt", has to contain the data needed by Panda3D Studio to create inner and outer borders for various widgets; the "borders.txt" file included in "default/atlas.zip" can be used as a template. The latter, "gfx_ids.txt", defines which image files are used for which widgets; the "gfx_ids.txt" file included in "default/atlas.zip" can once again be used as a template.

The custom skin subdirectory can optionally contain three subdirectories of its own:
*) "cursors": contains the cursors used by the GUI;
*) "fonts": contains the fonts used by the GUI (each font can be inside its own subdirectory).
*) "layout": contains text files that are used to define the layouts of toolbars, control panels and dialogs.
If any of these directories are not found, the corresponding data will be loaded from the default skin.
